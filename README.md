# Deep Learning RAG Interview Prep Agent

A RAG-powered interview preparation agent built with LangChain, LangGraph,
and ChromaDB. Ingest deep learning study material and chat with it to
generate and answer technical interview questions.

---

## Overview

You are on a team with distinct roles, each owning a critical piece
of the system. The Corpus Architect is the foundation — without quality
study material, the entire RAG pipeline has nothing to retrieve. The
Pipeline Engineer is the backbone — they wire together ChromaDB,
LangChain, and LangGraph into a working system. The UX Lead is the
face — they own the interface and the demo narrative that the judges
will see in Part 3. The Prompt Engineer is the voice — they control
how the agent thinks, asks questions, and evaluates answers. The QA
Lead is the conscience — they stress test the system, find the failure
cases, and performs quality assurance. No role works in isolation. 
Every role depends on every other role
delivering on time. This is not an individual assignment — it is a
team system design interview. Here is the breakdown for tonight:

### Part 1 — Align and Launch 

The goal of Part 1 is to make sure every team member understands the
full system before anyone writes a line of code.

**Role Lock**
Roles are confirmed and posted. Every team member knows exactly what
they own.

**Sketch the System**
Before anyone opens a laptop to build, get together as a team and complete `docs/architecture.md`. 
Complete `docs/architecture.md` before Part 2 begins.

**Good Chunk vs Bad Chunk Demo**
Understand what a well-formed chunk looks like versus
a poorly formed one. This directly determines retrieval quality. See
`examples/sample_chunk.json` for the canonical reference.

**Parallel Workstream Kickoff**
Everyone starts their role simultaneously. The Corpus Architect begins
drafting. The Pipeline Engineer begins setup with the rest of the team
watching. No one is idle.

---

### Part 2 - The Build 

The goal of Part 2 is to produce a working end-to-end system. This is
the hackathon. Every role has a clear milestone and a clear definition
of done.

Part 2 is split into two phases with a mandatory team meet in the
middle.

**Phase 1 — Parallel Build**
Each role works toward their Phase 1 milestone independently. The
Corpus Architect drafts core topics. The Pipeline Engineer implements
the backend stubs in order. The UX Lead builds the static three-panel
layout. The Prompt Engineer manually tests all three prompts. The QA
Lead writes the test plan and Part 3 questions.

**Team Standup**
Every team member answers three questions: what do I have, what do I
need, what is blocking me. This is the only moment where everyone
stops building and syncs.

**Phase 2 — Integration and Hardening**
Roles converge. The corpus gets ingested and tested. The UI wires to
the backend. Prompts go live inside the LangGraph nodes. The QA Lead
runs the full test plan against the integrated system.

**Demo Rehearsal**
One full end-to-end run-through before Part 3. 

See `docs/checklist.md` for the full per-role breakdown of both phases.

---

### Part 3 — Presentations

The goal of Part 3 is to present what you built under interview
conditions. Every team presents and every team judges.

**Team Demos**
Each team does a live demo structured exactly like a technical screen.
No slides — the running application is your presentation. The demo
must show ingestion, duplicate detection, a successful query with
source citation, and the hallucination guard firing on an off-topic
question. Each member must present. F2F presents in class. Online teams will
create a 5 minute video.

---

### The Thread That Connects All Three Parts

Every decision you make in Part 1 affects what you can build in Part 2.
Every decision you make in Part 2 affects what you can defend in Part 3.
The goal is to explain every thing your team has done
and why.

## Corpus Architect

You start immediately — independently, right now, while the Pipeline
Engineer sets up the environment with the rest of the team.

### Your First Task — Draft 3 Topics

Open your preferred editor and begin drafting study material for the
first three core topics. Do not wait for the backend to be ready.
Your content is the foundation everything else depends on.

**Start with these three topics in this order:**
1. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
3. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

**Before writing a single chunk, agree on the metadata schema
with the Pipeline Engineer.** Every chunk must follow this structure:

```json
{
  "chunk_text": "...",
  "metadata": {
    "topic": "ANN",
    "difficulty": "intermediate",
    "type": "concept_explanation",
    "source": "ann.md",
    "related_topics": ["backpropagation", "activation_functions"],
    "is_bonus": false
  }
}
```

See `examples/sample_chunk.json` for the full schema with validation
rules and a quality checklist.

**Chunk writing rules:**
- One atomic idea per chunk — if it could answer five interview questions, split it
- Minimum 100 words, maximum 300 words per chunk
- If you remove the topic name from the chunk, the content should still
  identify the topic — if not, it is too generic
- Each chunk should stand alone as the basis for exactly one interview question

**File naming convention:**
```
data/corpus/ann_intermediate.md
data/corpus/cnn_intermediate.md
data/corpus/rnn_intermediate.md
```

**An Example of One of the Markdown Files**
```
# Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

## The Vanishing Gradient Problem
Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) solve the vanishing gradient 
problem that affects standard RNNs. They do this through three learned 
gates...

## The Forget Gate
The forget gate decides what information to discard from the cell state.
It takes the previous hidden state and current input, passes them through
a sigmoid function...

## The Input Gate
The input gate decides what new information to store in the cell state.
It consists of two parts: a sigmoid layer that decides which values to
update...
```

**Landmark papers — locate these while you draft:**

| Topic | Paper |
|---|---|
| ANN / Backprop | Rumelhart, Hinton & Williams (1986) |
| CNN | LeCun et al. (1998) LeNet |
| CNN deep | Krizhevsky et al. (2012) AlexNet |
| RNN | Elman (1990) |
| LSTM | Hochreiter & Schmidhuber (1997) |
| Seq2Seq | Sutskever, Vinyals & Le (2014) |
| Autoencoder | Hinton & Salakhutdinov (2006) |
| GAN *(bonus)* | Goodfellow et al. (2014) |
| Boltzmann *(bonus)* | Hinton & Sejnowski (1986) |
| SOM *(bonus)* | Kohonen (1982) |

Place downloaded PDFs in `data/corpus/`.

**Your Phase 1 milestone:**
- [ ] 3 topics drafted with at least 3 chunks each
- [ ] Metadata schema agreed with Pipeline Engineer
- [ ] At least one landmark paper PDF located per topic

---

## Pipeline Engineer

You are responsible for environment setup. The UX Lead, Prompt Engineer,
and QA Lead will set up alongside you — walk them through each step
and talk through decisions out loud. This is your first system design
conversation as a team.

### Step 1 — Clone the Repo (everyone does this)

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd deep-learning-rag-agent
```

### Step 2 — Install UV

UV is a fast modern Python package manager. Install it first if you
do not have it.

**Mac / Linux:**
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

Verify installation:
```bash
uv --version
```

### Step 3 — Create Virtual Environment and Install Dependencies

```bash
uv sync
```

This reads `pyproject.toml` and installs all dependencies into a
local `.venv` folder. This is the only command needed — no separate
`pip install` required.

### Step 4 — Configure Environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and fill in your LLM provider credentials.
See the [LLM Provider Setup](#llm-provider-setup) section below.

### Step 5 — Verify Setup

```bash
uv run python -c "import chromadb; import langchain; import langgraph; print('All dependencies OK')"
```

If this passes, environment setup is complete.

### Step 6 — Run the App

```bash
uv run streamlit run src/rag_agent/ui/app.py
```

You will see a `NotImplementedError`. This is expected — the stubs
are in place and waiting for your implementation. Your job is now
to work through the stack trace and implement each stub in order.

**Implementation order:**
1. `EmbeddingFactory._create_local()` in `config.py`
2. `VectorStoreManager._initialise()` in `store.py`
3. `VectorStoreManager.check_duplicate()` in `store.py`
4. `VectorStoreManager.ingest()` in `store.py`
5. `VectorStoreManager.query()` in `store.py`
6. LangGraph nodes in `nodes.py`
7. Graph assembly in `graph.py`

**Your Phase 1 milestone:**
- [ ] `uv sync` completes without errors for all team members
- [ ] `.env` configured with working LLM provider
- [ ] `EmbeddingFactory._create_local()` implemented
- [ ] `VectorStoreManager._initialise()` implemented
- [ ] `VectorStoreManager.check_duplicate()` implemented
- [ ] Hello world retrieval returning results

---

## UX Lead

While the Pipeline Engineer runs setup, sit with the team and
follow along. You do not need to understand every line of the
backend code — but you need to understand what it returns.

### While Watching Setup — Think About These

**On the API contract:**
The methods you will call from `ui/app.py` are already defined
in the codebase. Open these two files now and read them while
setup is running:

- `src/rag_agent/agent/state.py` — all the data models you will
  receive back: `IngestionResult`, `RetrievedChunk`, `AgentResponse`
- `src/rag_agent/vectorstore/store.py` — the methods you will call:
  `ingest()`, `list_documents()`, `get_document_chunks()`, `query()`

You are not waiting for the Pipeline Engineer to define these —
they are already there. What you do need to coordinate with the
Pipeline Engineer is:

- Confirm method signatures have not changed as they implement the stubs
- Agree on how errors are surfaced — does `ingest()` raise an exception
  or return errors inside `IngestionResult`? The answer is in `state.py`
  but make sure you both read it the same way

**On your framework choice:**
Decide now — Streamlit or Gradio. Do not switch mid-sprint.
- **Streamlit** → deploy to [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://share.streamlit.io)
- **Gradio** → deploy to [HuggingFace Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces)

**On the three panels you need to build:**
1. Document ingestion — multi-file upload, status display, document list
2. Document viewer — selectable documents, content display, chunk viewer
3. Chat interface — history display, query input, source citations

**On session state:**
Streamlit reruns the entire script on every user interaction.
Everything that needs to persist (chat history, ingested documents,
VectorStoreManager instance) must live in `st.session_state`.
During setup, ask the Pipeline Engineer to walk through `app.py`
line by line — the `initialise_session_state()` function is your
starting point.

**Your Phase 1 milestone:**
- [ ] Framework chosen and confirmed with team
- [ ] Data models in `state.py` read and understood
- [ ] Static three-panel layout running locally with placeholder content
- [ ] `st.session_state` keys initialised correctly

---

## Prompt Engineer

While the Pipeline Engineer runs setup, sit with the team and
follow along. Your job during setup is to understand the data
flow so you can write prompts that work with real retrieved chunks.

### While Watching Setup — Think About These

**On the system prompt:**
Open `src/rag_agent/agent/prompts.py` now. Read `SYSTEM_PROMPT`
carefully. Ask yourself:
- Does this persona match what we want the agent to do?
- Are the constraints strict enough to prevent hallucination?
- Is the citation instruction clear enough to produce consistent output?

**On the question generation prompt:**
The `QUESTION_GENERATION_PROMPT` asks the model to return JSON.
Think about failure modes — what happens if the model returns
malformed JSON? Talk to the Pipeline Engineer about how to handle
parsing errors gracefully.

**On testing prompts before integration:**
You do not need the backend to be running to test prompts. Open
Claude, ChatGPT, or your chosen LLM in a browser and manually test
each prompt right now while setup is running. Iterate before you
integrate.

There are three prompts in `src/rag_agent/agent/prompts.py` that
you own. Here is what each one does and how to test it manually:

**Prompt 1 — System Prompt (`SYSTEM_PROMPT`)**
This defines the agent's identity, constraints, and behavior. It
instructs the model to answer only from retrieved context, always
cite sources, and indicate when no relevant content is found.

To test: paste `SYSTEM_PROMPT` into your LLM of choice as the
first message, then paste the sample chunk from
`examples/sample_chunk.json` as context, then ask a question about
LSTMs. Verify the model cites the source and does not go beyond
what the chunk says.

Example test input:
```
[System Prompt here]

Context:
[paste sample_chunk.json chunk_text here]

Question: What problem do LSTMs solve and how?
```

Expected behavior: the model answers using only the chunk content
and cites `[SOURCE: LSTM | lstm.md]`. If it adds information not
in the chunk, tighten the system prompt constraints.

---

**Prompt 2 — Question Generation (`QUESTION_GENERATION_PROMPT`)**
Given a retrieved chunk, this prompt generates one interview question
at a specified difficulty level and returns a structured JSON response
with the question, model answer, and a follow-up question.

To test: paste the prompt into your LLM, substitute the sample chunk
for `{context}` and `intermediate` for `{difficulty}`. Verify the
output is valid JSON and the question requires genuine understanding,
not just recall.

Example test input:
```
[QUESTION_GENERATION_PROMPT with placeholders filled in]

{context}: Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) solve the 
vanishing gradient problem through three learned gates: the forget 
gate, input gate, and output gate...

{difficulty}: intermediate
```

Expected output:
```json
{
  "question": "Explain how the three gates in an LSTM work together
               to solve the vanishing gradient problem",
  "difficulty": "intermediate",
  "topic": "LSTM",
  "model_answer": "...",
  "follow_up": "How would you decide between using an LSTM versus
                a standard RNN for a given task?",
  "source_citations": ["[SOURCE: LSTM | lstm.md]"]
}
```

If the model returns malformed JSON or a trivial yes/no question,
revise the prompt and test again before handing to the Pipeline
Engineer for integration.

---

**Prompt 3 — Answer Evaluation (`ANSWER_EVALUATION_PROMPT`)**
Given a question, a student's answer, and the source chunk, this
prompt evaluates the answer and returns a score out of 10 with
detailed feedback.

To test: paste the prompt with a question from your Prompt 2 test,
write a deliberately incomplete answer, and verify the model
correctly identifies what is missing.

Example test input:
```
[ANSWER_EVALUATION_PROMPT with placeholders filled in]

{question}: Explain how the three gates in an LSTM work together
            to solve the vanishing gradient problem

{candidate_answer}: LSTMs have gates that control what information
                    is kept or forgotten, which helps with long
                    sequences.

{context}: [paste sample chunk here]
```

Expected output: a score around 4-5 out of 10, correctly identifying
that the candidate understood the general concept but did not name
or explain the three gates specifically. If the score seems too
generous or too harsh, adjust the scoring guide in the prompt.

---

The key thing to watch for across all three prompts is
**JSON reliability** — the Pipeline Engineer will be parsing
these responses programmatically. If the model occasionally
returns prose instead of JSON, add this line to the affected
prompts: `Respond with the JSON object only. No preamble,
explanation, or markdown code fences.`

**On difficulty levels:**
How will the system know what difficulty to generate questions at?
Where does that instruction come from — the user, the metadata,
or a default? Decide this with the UX Lead during setup.

**Your Phase 1 milestone:**
- [ ] All three prompts read and understood
- [ ] System prompt reviewed and any changes noted
- [ ] Question generation prompt manually tested against sample chunk
- [ ] Answer evaluation prompt manually tested
- [ ] Failure modes documented for each prompt

---

## QA Lead

While the Pipeline Engineer runs setup, sit with the team and
follow along. Your job during setup is to understand the system
well enough to break it later.

### While Watching Setup — Think About These

**On the test plan:**
Read `tests/test_vectorstore.py` now. These are the unit tests
the Pipeline Engineer needs to make pass. Your job in Phase 2
is to run five integration test cases against the full system.
Start writing those test cases during setup:

| Test | Input | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| Normal query | "Explain vanishing gradient" | Relevant chunks, source cited |
| Off-topic query | "History of Rome" | No context found message |
| Duplicate ingestion | Upload same file twice | Second upload skipped |
| Empty query | Blank input | Graceful error, no crash |
| Cross-topic query | "How do LSTMs improve on RNNs" | Multi-topic retrieval |

**On Part 3 questions:**
You are responsible for drafting three technical interview questions
your team will ask opponents in Part 3. Rules:
- Must be answerable from a well-built corpus
- At least one must connect two topics
- Prepare a model answer for each

**Your Phase 1 milestone:**
- [ ] Five integration test cases written
- [ ] Team risk assessment completed against rubric
- [ ] Three Part 3 interview questions drafted with model answers
- [ ] Demo script outline started (ingestion → duplicate → query → guard → question)

---

## LLM Provider Setup

### Option 1 — Groq (Recommended: free, fast, no local GPU needed)

1. Create a free account at [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com)
2. Generate an API key under **API Keys**
3. In `.env`:
```
LLM_PROVIDER=groq
GROQ_API_KEY=your_key_here
GROQ_MODEL=llama-3.1-8b-instant
```

Available models (free tier): `llama-3.1-8b-instant`, `llama-3.1-70b-versatile`, `mixtral-8x7b-32768`

**Interview talking point:** Groq uses a custom LPU (Language Processing Unit)
chip designed for LLM inference, delivering significantly lower latency
than GPU-based inference APIs.

---

### Option 2 — Ollama (Fully local, no API key, runs offline)

1. Download and install from [ollama.com](https://ollama.com)
2. Pull a model:
```bash
ollama pull llama3.2        # 2B — fast, low memory
ollama pull mistral         # 7B — better quality
ollama pull llama3.1:8b     # 8B — good balance
```
3. Start Ollama before running the app:
```bash
ollama serve
```
4. In `.env`:
```
LLM_PROVIDER=ollama
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434
OLLAMA_MODEL=llama3.2
```

Verify Ollama is running:
```bash
curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags
```

**Interview talking point:** Local inference eliminates data privacy
concerns and removes API cost entirely — important for enterprise
deployments with proprietary training data.

---

### Option 3 — LM Studio (Local GUI, OpenAI-compatible API)

1. Download from [lmstudio.ai](https://lmstudio.ai)
2. Open LM Studio → **Discover** → download a model
   (recommended: Llama 3.2 3B Instruct or Mistral 7B Instruct)
3. Go to **Local Server** tab → Load model → Start Server
4. In `.env`:
```
LLM_PROVIDER=lmstudio
LMSTUDIO_BASE_URL=http://localhost:1234/v1
LMSTUDIO_MODEL=local-model
```

**Interview talking point:** LM Studio exposes an OpenAI-compatible API —
any tooling written for OpenAI works without code changes, just a
`base_url` swap. This is the adapter pattern in practice.

---

## Deployment

### Streamlit Community Cloud (Streamlit UI teams)

1. Push code to a public GitHub repository
2. Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
3. Connect GitHub → select repo, branch, and `src/rag_agent/ui/app.py`
4. Under **Advanced Settings → Secrets**, add your `.env` variables
5. Click **Deploy**

### HuggingFace Spaces (Gradio UI teams, or Streamlit teams)

1. Create a free account at [huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co)
2. Go to **Spaces → Create New Space**
3. Choose **Streamlit** or **Gradio** as the SDK
4. Connect your GitHub repo
5. Add API keys under **Settings → Repository Secrets**

HuggingFace Spaces provides 16GB RAM on the free CPU tier — better
for memory-intensive embedding operations than Streamlit Community Cloud.

## Submitting Your Work

At least one team member must publish the finished project
to their personal GitHub account before the session ends.

To publish from VSCode:
1. Open Source Control in the sidebar
2. Click **Publish to GitHub**
3. Choose **Public**
4. Name it something memorable — this goes on your portfolio

All other team members should should do the same so every
team member has a personal copy under their own GitHub profile.
A working RAG agent is a strong portfolio piece — own it.

## Common Issues

**`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'rag_agent'`**
Run from the project root using `uv run`, not `python` directly.

**`NotImplementedError`**
Expected — the stubs are waiting for implementation. Follow the
stack trace to find the next method to implement.

**`chromadb.errors.NotEnoughElementsException`**
Your collection has fewer chunks than the requested `k`. Ingest
more content or reduce `RETRIEVAL_K` in `.env`.

**`ollama: connection refused`**
Ollama is not running. Start it with `ollama serve` in a separate terminal.

**Streamlit reruns on every click and loses state**
Wrap persistent objects in `@st.cache_resource`. Store conversation
history and document list in `st.session_state`.

**`data/chroma_db` does not exist**
Create it manually — see Step 5 of Pipeline Engineer setup above.
Once `VectorStoreManager._initialise()` is implemented, it will
create this directory automatically on startup.
